      <h3>From Trucking Roots to 360° Logistics</h3>
      <p>
      Founded in the mid-1990s, GSC began as a regional trucking operation with hundreds of trucks and multiple warehouses, leveraging decades of logistics expertise. Over time, customer needs expanded beyond transportation to 3PL and fulfillment solutions. In response, we streamlined our trucking services and evolved into GSC 360°, providing warehousing, fulfillment, freight management, and specialized handling—all under one roof. Over the years, we've partnered with industry leaders such as Electrolux, Bosch, QVC, Amazon, Mitsubishi, Keurig, Ajinomoto, ASMO, and Saudi German Company.
