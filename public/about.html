      <h3>From Trucking Beginnings to Full-Service Warehousing</h3>
      <p>
        Founded in the mid-1990s as a local trucking company, GSC Logistics quickly discovered a pressing need
        for flexible, reliable warehousing solutions. Over the years, we transitioned from primarily trucking
        to a modern warehousing powerhouse—offering storage, packing, fulfillment, and more. Although local
        trucking remains available on request, our passion today is delivering the best in warehouse
        management and customer care.

      <h3>Our Facilities</h3>
      <p>
        We operate three spacious warehouses, each carefully chosen for its proximity to major shipping routes,
        ports, and highways. Whether you’re a small startup looking for overflow storage or a large enterprise
        seeking a full-scale distribution hub, we have room to grow with you.
