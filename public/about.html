      <h3>From Trucking Roots to 360° Logistics</h3>
      <p>
        Founded in the mid-1990s, GSC began as a regional trucking operation. Over time, our customers needed more 
        than just transport—they needed holistic solutions. We evolved into GSC 360°, offering warehousing, 
        fulfillment, freight management, and specialized handling under one roof.

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        We aim to help businesses large and small “go further” by providing efficient, reliable, and transparent 
        logistics solutions. At GSC 360, we pride ourselves on continuous improvement, sustainability initiatives, 
        and building lasting partnerships with our clients.

      <h3>Our Facilities</h3>
      <p>
        Across our three warehouses in North Carolina and Virginia, we have a total footprint of 
        <strong>1,000,000 sq ft</strong>. Right now, <strong>158,750 sq ft</strong> are available for businesses in 
        need of flexible storage—though that number changes constantly as shipments come and go. Our locations are 
        near major ports, highways, and even an international runway, ensuring quick turnarounds.
